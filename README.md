## Overview
### Description
Aggregates grocery store options and matches user to a store they'd like to submit a grocery order to. 

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Shopping
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile.
- **Story:** Allows user to specify choose a nearby grocery store to purchase items for quick delivery. Additionally, a user may pick a favorite item and see which stores have it. Once given that information, they can proceed to purchase from the store that has the specific item they need. This saves the user's time from having to click into each nearby store to see if they have the item.
- **Market:** Users of all ages, but we'd specifically target primary grocery shoppers of the household.
- **Habit:** This app would be used at the same freuency the user completes grocery shopping on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly cadence.
- **Scope:** First we match users to their nearby stores. Then we allow the user to filter stores that have their favorite item.
